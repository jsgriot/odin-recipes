  <h2>It's perfect for a Sunday brunch.</h2>

  <p>Everybody should have a few good quiche recipes in their back pocket, and this one is a keeper! Spinach quiche is always a hit for Sunday brunch with a fresh fruit salad, candied bacon, and garlicky breakfast potatoes, but it's also great for dinner—especially if you bake it in a beautiful pie pan! The beauty of quiche is that it looks fancy, but it's so darn easy.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>1 refrigerated pie crust (from a 14-oz. box)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. butter </li>
    <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 small red bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 1/4 c. half-and-half</li>
    <li>1/2 c. sour cream</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. black pepper</li>
    <li>Pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 (10-oz.) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
    <li>1 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 c. finely shredded parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F with a baking sheet on the center rack. Fit the pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate (about 1-inch deep). Fold the edges of the crust under and crimp as desired. Chill in the refrigerator while preparing the filling.</li>

    <li>In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat</li>

    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, sour cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in the spinach, cheddar, parmesan, and bell pepper mixture. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>

    <li>Place the quiche on the preheated baking sheet and bake until it has puffed in the center, is just set, and the crust is golden, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer the quiche to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Tip: Spinach quiche can be made up to a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature before serving.</p>
