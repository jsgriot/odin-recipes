  <p>If you ask us, overnight oats are a near perfect everyday breakfast option. They take almost no time to prep â€” and oats are one budget-friendly pantry staple that we always seem to have on-hand. Best of all, once you have a great base recipe (like this one) you can customize them any way you like</p>

  <h3>Directions:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>To make a jar, just combine 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed, 2/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup plain yogurt, 2 teaspoons brown sugar or maple syrup and a pinch each of salt and cinnamon in a small jar. Add your mix-ins (see below for some of our favorites), seal the jar and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, just open the jar, stir and add toppings.</li>
